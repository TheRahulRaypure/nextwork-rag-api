An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different programs to communicate with each other and answer questions.

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) API is an AI-powered API that answers questions by:
Retrieving relevant information from your knowledge base (documents)
Augmenting a prompt with that retrieved information
Generating an answer using an LLM (Large Language Model)

This combines the accuracy of search with the natural language capabilities of AI models!
